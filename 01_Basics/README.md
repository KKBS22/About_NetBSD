# What is an OS?
An Operating System is a layer of software that enables a platform upon which application programs can be written and contols the access to the hardware resources that is used by
the programs.

There are a set of rules by which an OS must abide to meet the requirements of the certification. This OS standard for UNIX Systems is called POSIX(Portable Operating Systems Interface).
Which defines the API, Command Line utilites etc, and has developed into what is called the SUS(Single UNIX specification) 

# Basics of UNIX
The Unix operating system consists, somewhat simplified, of three major
components.
* Kernel : It controls the Hardware, schedules tasks, and interfaces with various devices
* Libraries : They proivde an interface to the Kernel  
	* System Calls, run in privileged mode or in Kernel Space
	* Library Functions that are unprivileged run in user space
* Tools and Applications :Using these libraries provide functionality to the enduser.
